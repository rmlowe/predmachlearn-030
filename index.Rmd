First we subdivide `pml-training.csv` into training and cross-validation sets.

```{r}
pml <- read.csv(file = "pml-training.csv", na.strings = c("NA", "#DIV/0!"))
library(caret)
inTrain <- createDataPartition(y = pml$classe, p = 0.75, list = FALSE)
training <- pml[inTrain, ]
testing <- pml[-inTrain, ]
#preProc <- preProcess(x = pml, method = "pca", pcaComp = 2)
#modelFit <- train(classe ~ ., data = training, method = "glm")
```
